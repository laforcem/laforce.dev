When I was first thinking about starting a personal website earlier this year, I wanted it to be a place where I could share the stuff I'm really passionate about. There's a lot of that, of course, but what I really wanted to go into was the hours and hours I've spent just tinkering with audio files and messing around. So, it's fitting that my first blog post on here should be sort of an introduction to what got me into audio engineering stuff.

## Into the Rabbit Hole

I first started listening to ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) in late 2018 after watching Guardians of the Galaxy 1 & 2 for the first time. For those not familiar, they're this 70s/80s band from Birmingham, England. They've released a number of popular songs, including the ever-iconic "Mr. Blue Sky". That song in particular hooked me, and I binge-listened to the band's discography in early 2019.

I first crawled into the rabbit hole in May of that year, when I started to get involved with the existing ELO fanbase.
