I have run a number of Minecraft servers over the years, both modded and vanilla. Most of the time, I would just pay a relatively reasonable amount to host them on a service such as PebbleHost, and I paid the bill quarterly. However, as I advanced through my computer science degree program and learned more about automation, Java, and the Linux shell, it seemed to me like it wouldn't be too horribly difficult to just run one on the technical end myself.  

Luckily for me (and whomever may be reading this), Oracle provides the hardware to make this possible - for free. You can [sign up here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) for an account. It seems that Oracle may have missed their big opportunity in the cloud computing space that is now dominated by AWS, Azure, and GCloud, so their competition is a very generous free tier.
