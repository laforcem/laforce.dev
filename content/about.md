## Hey there!

My name is Malcolm La Force. I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines. Various classes at Mines and explorations of my own have piqued my interest in DevOps and web development. Eventually, I'd like to code this website from scratch, but for now I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for ease of content creation.

Outside of CS, I've found an interest in graphic design and audio engineering. My graphic design projects are mainly vintage poster restorations from musicians that I enjoy, but I'll sometimes work with my SO to create original designs as well. For audio engineering, I enjoy restoring and remixing audio from these same bands. These songs are often unreleased and in fairly low quality, so I try to restore them to make them more enjoyable to listen to. There have been some really fun projects surrounding this that I will be posting about in the future.

Thanks for visiting!
