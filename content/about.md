Thanks for visiting my portfolio & technical blog! I'm Malcolm. I work full-time as an associate developer and have a great passion for a variety of computer science fields. My work (and the influence of my colleagues) has inspired me to pursue homelabbing and self-hosting, which has been a tremendous learning experience and source of joy for me. I also love working on web apps and, strangely, writing detailed technical docs. Go figure.

When I'm not at work or compulsively overcomplicating my homelab, I love to study theology or go on a hike. I'll gladly partake in a good, quality conversation with just about anyone, too. My favorite album is *Trench* by twenty one pilots and my favorite color is any shade of cyan.
